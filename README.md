# surprise and...

i often feel like my nervous system is too entrenched in corporate software culture.
this project is an exercise in "deprogramming" my own nervous system by weakening or confusing word associations.

"surprise and delight" is a phrase commonly used on software development teams to describe a feature or interaction (usually something small) that people won't expect and will bring some small joy.
