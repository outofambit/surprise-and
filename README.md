# surprise and...

i often feel like my brain is too entrenched in software culture.
this project is an exercise in "deprogramming" my own nervous system by weakening or confusing word associations.
"surprise and delight" is a common phrase used on software development teams to describe a feature or interaction (usually something small) that people won't expect and will appreciate or bring some small joy.
